'''
Authors: Jimmy Wu, Rajat Kumar Jenamani
This RPC server allows other processes (such as arm_client.py, joint_state_publisher.py) to communicate with the Kinova arm 
low-level controller (arm_server.py), which runs in its own, dedicated real-time process.

Note: Operations that are not time-sensitive should be run in a separate,
non-real-time process to avoid interfering with the real-time low-level
control and causing latency spikes.
